Context
This section comes after “How VisaVet Works.”
The product is a professional, trust-based visa advisory review service.
The design must remain elite, calm, and institutional — not flashy, not SaaS-like.

SECTION 1: What We Review

Create a full-width section titled:

What We Review

Place the heading centered or left-aligned (consistent with earlier sections).
Keep typography restrained and professional.

Background

The background of this section should use a flowing gradient inspired by the provided image.

The gradient should feel like a slow-moving horizon

Dark at the top, gently transitioning into soft blue tones

Use subtle motion (very slow vertical or diagonal gradient movement)

No sharp transitions, no neon colors, no animation that draws attention

This background should feel ambient, not decorative.

Grid Layout

Inside this section, create a 4 × 4 grid of small white cards.

Cards should be clean, minimal, and text-only

White or very light off-white background

Soft blue glow around each card (very subtle)

Rounded corners, but not playful

No borders, no icons, no images, no emojis

Plenty of spacing between cards

Each card contains:

A short title (bold)

One short explanatory line (plain text)

Card Content (What We Review)

Use calm, neutral language.
Do NOT imply guarantees, scoring, or approval.

Here is the exact content to use across the grid (you may reorder visually):

Public social media posts
We review publicly visible posts across major platforms.

Profile biographies and descriptions
Bios are checked for consistency and clarity.

Usernames and identifiers
We look at how identifiers appear across platforms.

Employment references
Public mentions of work history are reviewed.

Education references
Publicly stated education details are checked.

Location indicators
Public location signals are reviewed for consistency.

Public comments and replies
Visible interactions are included in the review.

Shared links and content
Frequently shared content is reviewed at a high level.

Group and page associations
Public group affiliations are considered.

Account visibility settings
We confirm what information is publicly accessible.

Timeline consistency
Public timelines are reviewed for alignment.

Language tone and patterns
General tone is reviewed contextually.

Public profile images
Profile images are reviewed as part of identity context.

Public activity frequency
Activity patterns are observed at a high level.

Search visibility
We check what appears when names are searched publicly.

General public footprint
A summary view of overall public presence.

Keep each description one line only.

SECTION 2: Client Reviews

Below the “What We Review” grid, create a Client Reviews section.

Title it simply:

Client Reviews

Reviews Layout

Reviews should appear in horizontal cards

Cards move slowly from right to left in a continuous loop

Motion should be calm and slow, not distracting

Pause animation on hover

No autoplay speed changes

Do not use star ratings, avatars, or logos.

Review Card Style

Each review card should include:

A short testimonial (2–3 lines)

A subtle identifier like:

“F-1 Applicant”

“H-1B Applicant”

“Parent of Student”

No names

No photos

No locations

Cards should be neutral in tone, not emotional.

Sample Review Copy

Use content like this (paraphrase if needed, but keep tone):

“The report was clear and detailed. It helped me understand what information was visible online and what to be mindful of before my interview.”
F-1 Applicant

“I appreciated that the review felt thoughtful and not automated. It gave me clarity without making promises.”
H-1B Applicant

“The process was professional and reassuring. The report helped us feel more prepared.”
Parent of Student

Important Restrictions (Do Not Break These)

Do NOT:

Add icons or symbols

Add star ratings

Add company logos

Add names or faces

Add emojis

Add aggressive animations

Add CTA buttons in this section

This section should reinforce trust, not push conversion.

Overall Feel Reminder

This entire section should feel like:

A compliance or advisory firm

A quiet, confident service

Something that feels “real” and considered

Not a startup showcase.
Not a marketing site.
Not a SaaS dashboard.
