Do not redesign the site.
Do not change layout structure, section order, colors, fonts, or spacing outside what is mentioned below.
All existing sections, components, and styling should remain exactly the same unless explicitly modified here.

Focus only on content refinement, subtle animation, hover behavior, and responsiveness.

1️⃣ TRANSITION FROM HERO → “HOW VISAVET WORKS”

At the start of the How VisaVet Works section:

Increase the size of the heading text “How VisaVet Works” slightly so it feels like a clear section break and anchor.

Add a subtle, premium animation on load:

Gentle upward fade-in

Slight opacity + blur resolve

No bounce, no overshoot, no dramatic motion

Use the available vertical space in this section more intentionally.

Directly below the heading, add a short explanatory paragraph (centered or left-aligned as it already is):

This is not an AI-generated summary or an automated scan.
Each review is conducted through a structured process that combines technology-assisted analysis with careful human evaluation, designed to reflect how modern visa screening interprets public digital signals.

Keep this paragraph calm, professional, and readable.
No badges, no icons, no callouts.

Everything else in this section (steps, layout, interactions) remains as previously implemented.

2️⃣ “WHAT WE REVIEW” SECTION — REFINEMENT ONLY

In the What We Review section:

Reduce the number of cards to 8 total

Make each card slightly larger to allow more readable text

Add a soft blue glow on hover (increase glow slightly compared to before)

Keep the grid layout and background exactly the same

Each card should contain a short title and a 1–2 line description, written in plain language.

Use the following content (paraphrase lightly if needed, but keep meaning intact):

Public Posts & Content
Visible posts, captions, and shared content that contribute to your public narrative.

Profile Bios & Descriptions
How your self-descriptions align across platforms and with your application story.

Timeline Consistency
Public activity patterns that align with stated education, work, and travel history.

Platform Cross-Alignment
Whether different platforms tell a coherent and consistent story.

Visible Affiliations
Publicly visible groups, pages, or interests you are associated with.

Interaction Patterns
How public comments, reactions, and engagements appear in context.

Name & Identity Signals
Username choices, naming consistency, and recognizability across platforms.

Overall Public Visibility
The level and nature of what is publicly accessible at the time of review.

Do not add scores, flags, or risk labels.

3️⃣ CLIENT REVIEWS SECTION — VISUAL & CONTENT ENHANCEMENT

In the client reviews/testimonials section:

Make each review card slightly larger

Increase the glow intensity around each card (still soft and premium, not neon)

Maintain the existing scrolling / motion behavior

Each review card should now include:

A short review quote (2–3 lines max)

A realistic first name and initial (e.g., “Ananya R.”, “David K.”, “Rohit M.”)

A subtle role or context line (e.g., “F-1 Applicant”, “H-1B Renewal”, “B1/B2 Visitor”)

Example tone (do not copy verbatim):

Calm

Relieved

Professional

No claims of approval or guarantees

Text should feel like feedback on clarity, confidence, and preparedness, not outcomes.

4️⃣ RESPONSIVENESS & MOBILE BEHAVIOR (NO REDESIGN)

Ensure the following without changing visual identity:

All sections scale cleanly on mobile and tablet

Cards stack gracefully with preserved spacing

Hover effects translate into subtle tap feedback on mobile

Text remains readable without truncation

Navigation / menu requirements:

Mobile menu should be fully functional

Menu opens and closes smoothly

All links work correctly

No layout shifts or overlapping elements
