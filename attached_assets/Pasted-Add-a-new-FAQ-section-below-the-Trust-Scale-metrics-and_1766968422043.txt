Add a new FAQ section below the “Trust & Scale” metrics and above the client reviews.
Keep the overall visual language consistent with the rest of the site: dark background, subtle gradients, soft glow, premium spacing.

The FAQ section should feel calm, reassuring, and authoritative — not salesy.

Layout & Behavior

Display FAQs as stacked expandable cards (accordion style).

Each question appears as a single-line heading.

On click:

The card expands smoothly downward.

Background turns slightly lighter (deep navy/charcoal).

A soft blue glow appears around the expanded card.

Only one FAQ should stay open at a time.

Animations should be subtle and slow (ease-in-out).

Fully responsive:

On mobile, cards span full width.

Tap targets should be large and readable.

FAQ Content (Use Exactly This Copy)
Is this an AI-generated report?

No. We use technology to surface patterns such as sentiment signals, keyword clusters, timeline overlaps, and cross-platform inconsistencies.
Every surfaced signal is then reviewed by a human analyst who evaluates context, intent, and how the content may be interpreted without your explanation.
The final report is written manually and reflects judgment — not automation.

What exactly do you analyze?

We analyze your publicly visible digital presence across declared platforms, including posts, bios, interactions, timelines, and cross-platform consistency.
This includes both signal detection (what stands out) and narrative alignment (how your online story reads as a whole).

How long does the review take?

Most reports are delivered within 4–5 hours.
This allows sufficient time for both technology-assisted analysis and careful human evaluation, without rushing or auto-generating results.

Is this a one-time payment?

Yes. VisaVet is a one-time payment.
After your report is delivered, you can return to the portal to request clarifications, follow-up analysis, or future reviews without paying again.

Can I use this service again in the future?

Yes. Your access remains open.
If your online presence changes or you apply for another visa later, you can request an updated analysis through the same portal.

Will this guarantee my visa approval?

No service can guarantee visa outcomes.
VisaVet helps reduce uncertainty by identifying how your public digital presence may be interpreted during modern visa screening.

Do you access private messages or private accounts?

No. We do not access private messages, DMs, locked profiles, or anything not publicly visible.
Only public information and profiles you voluntarily disclose are reviewed.

Should I delete content before using VisaVet?

We generally advise against sudden deletions.
The report focuses on interpretive risk and preparation — helping you understand what may require explanation rather than prompting reactive changes.

Visual Notes for Replit (Important)

Do not use icons, emojis, or illustrations.

Typography should remain consistent with the rest of the site.

Spacing should feel breathable and “elite”.

This section should feel like it belongs on a professional advisory firm’s website, not a SaaS FAQ dump.
