How VisaVet Works

Subline (optional, small):
A structured, context-aware review — not a scan.

Step 1 (Refined)

Tell Us Your Context

Short surface text (visible by default):

You share your background, visa type, and public profiles — the same way an officer sees your case.

On click → white popup expands with:

Why this matters
Visa screening is contextual. The same online activity can be interpreted very differently depending on visa category, travel history, and stated intent.

What you provide

Visa category you’re applying for

High-level purpose of travel

Public social media platforms used

Optional context you would otherwise explain in an interview

How this is used
This information frames how your public digital presence is interpreted — not judged in isolation.

Step 2 (Refined)

Structured Digital Review

Short surface text:

Your public online presence is reviewed the way modern screening systems interpret it.

On click → popup expands with:

How the review is done
We combine automated pattern analysis with human evaluation to review your publicly visible digital footprint.

What is examined

Consistency across platforms

Public biographical signals

Timeline alignment

Language tone and associations

Public visibility and discoverability

What this is not
This is not keyword hunting, sentiment scoring, or automated flagging. Context and interpretation matter.

Step 3 (Refined)

Receive a Human-Written Report

Short surface text:

You receive a written report — clear, calm, and actionable.

On click → popup expands with:

What you receive
A structured report outlining:

Observations (what is visible)

Consistency checks (what aligns or conflicts)

Advisory notes (what to be mindful of)

How it helps
The report helps you understand how your public presence may appear during visa screening — before it’s evaluated officially.

What we don’t do
We don’t predict outcomes, assign scores, or promise approvals.

🎨 INTERACTION & VISUAL DESIGN (IMPORTANT)
Glow + Hover Behavior

Each step is a text block, not a card

On hover:

Soft blue glow around the text

Slight background blur behind it

Cursor changes subtly (not dramatic)

Click Interaction

Clicking opens a centered white modal

Modal has:

Plenty of whitespace

Dark text

Calm typography

No close “X” icon — use “Close” text link

This subconsciously signals care and seriousness.

💬 CLIENT REVIEWS — REFINED

You were right again: these should evolve visually.

New Review Style

Full blue cards

White text

Soft white outer glow

Rounded corners

Slow horizontal motion (left → right)

Review Tone Rules

Calm

Observational

No emotional hype

No “life-changing” language
